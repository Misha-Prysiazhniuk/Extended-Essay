1. What background reading have you done?

- To be done

2. Have you prepared your RRS (Researcher's Reflection Space)? Maybe GitHub suits us all?

- Yes, Github is perfect

3. What are the next steps in conducting your research?

- Reading research papers; 
- Planning of the experiment;
- Reconsidering the essay overall(topic, question, tools)
- downloading the LLM

4. Introduce the requirements and assessment criteria for the subject.

Key Requirements
Topic Scope: Must be rooted in Computer Science, such as algorithmic analysis, machine learning efficiency, database design, or networking protocols. Avoid topics that are solely social/ITGS (e.g., social media usage) or purely historical.
Methodology: Students should show deep understanding through original code, simulations, or extensive analysis of existing data, rather than just a literature review.
Word Count: The limit is 4,000 words.
Structure: Must include a title page, table of contents, introduction, method, results, analysis, conclusion, and bibliography. 
Assessment Criteria (Total: 34 Marks)
Criterion A: Focus and Method (6 marks): The topic must be sharply defined, with a clear research question and appropriate, well-explained methodology.
Criterion B: Knowledge and Understanding (6 marks): Demonstrates accurate use of technical terminology and relevant, in-depth computer science knowledge.
Criterion C: Critical Thinking (12 marks): The core of the essay; involves analyzing, evaluating, and arguing about findings, not just presenting data.
Criterion D: Presentation (4 marks): Assesses structure, layout, and consistent formatting.
Criterion E: Engagement (6 marks): Assesses the student's reflection on their research process, typically shown in the RPPF (Reflections on planning and progress form). 

5. Share possible approaches and any potential problem that might rise.

- Hold a digital experiment using the LLM and different jailbreaking methods; download the local LLM.
- create visualizations on python analysing to which extent do different jailbreaking systems "break" the policy.
- I should write a program that will analyse the jailbreaking quality and create the visualizations.
- The problem is, I cannot put any unethical information into my extended essay;meanwhile jailbreaking requires a prompt that breaks the policy of the LLM
